Let's imagine a scenario where as a system owner I operate a fleet of windmills and on these windmills there is a temperature which monitors the health of the engine. My objective is to use the temperature data to notify my service agents of any critical issues our fleet of windmills. 

Case 1:In the Alarm severity=“CRITICAL”then 
		Create ticket in freshdesk application
		Post the message in Slack channel
		Send an email 
Case 2(default):In the Alarm severity=not CRITICAL then
		Send an SMS using Twilio application
